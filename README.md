The Meteo-Data-Plotter project is a R application showing the weather data I collected during a few years.

It's main interface is a [Shiny reactive website](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/), as illustrated below.
It can also export PDF, through R native interface.

Source data [are formatted in CSV](https://raw.github.com/wazari972/Meteo-Data-Plotter/master/Grenoble.csv) and look like that:
